        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Approach & Values</h2>
        <p>
          At Dimondra, we believe in building strong, lasting relationships. Not
          just offering one-time services. We take a hands-on approach, working
          closely with each client to understand their business, challenges, and
          goals. Every company is different, so we don&nbsp;t offer one-size-fits-all
          solutions. Instead, we take the time to listen, learn, and then create
          the right support that works for your specific needs and industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          We focus on real, practical results that help your business grow and
          your team succeed. Whether it&nbsp;s HR support, legal help, IT services,
          or business strategy, our team brings both expertise and care to every
          project.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Our Core Values:</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>Integrity</strong> – We always do what&nbsp;s right, even when
            it&nbsp;s not the easiest path.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Excellence</strong> – We aim high and continuously look for
            ways to do things better.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accountability</strong> – We take full responsibility for
            our work and outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Empathy</strong> – We listen, understand, and respect both
            people and businesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Collaboration</strong> – We work as your partner, not just a
